To-Do List App
This is a simple To-Do List web application that allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks. It saves tasks in the browser's localStorage to persist them across page reloads.


Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure of the webpage.
CSS3: Styling of the application.
JavaScript: Adding functionality such as adding, completing, and deleting tasks, as well as handling data persistence using localStorage.

Usage
Add a task: Type a task into the input field and click the "Add Task" button.
Complete a task: Click on any task to mark it as completed (strikethrough will appear).
